# Prompt for repository analysis
REPO_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert software engineering architect tasked with analyzing and explaining a GitHub repository to a fellow developer. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, yet concise architecture review document that highlights key aspects of the repository, including use cases, dependencies, architecture, security concerns, and other relevant information for integration or replication.
You will be provided with the contents of the repository (including file structure, code snippets, and documentation)
Begin your analysis by examining the following GitHub repository.
Now, carefully analyze the contents of the repository.
Based on your analysis, create a markdown document that serves as an architecture review. Structure your review using the following sections:

1. Executive Summary (in 2 sentences)
2. Architecture Overview, with an ASCII directory tree structure of the repo
3. Technical Use Cases
4. Dependencies
5. Security Concerns
6. How best to integrate the repo into other projects
7. How best to emulate the critical parts of the code in a similar way

For each section, follow these guidelines:

1. Executive Summary:
   - Provide a brief overview of the repository's purpose and key features
   - Highlight the most important findings from your analysis

2. Architecture Overview:
   - Describe the high-level architecture of the software, with key design patterns and architectural decisions
   - Include a visual markdown flowchart of the repository's structure

3. Use Cases:
   - Identify and explain the potential technical use cases for this repository
   - Provide examples of how the software can be utilized

4. Dependencies:
   - List a table of all dependencies and their versions
   - Explain why these dependencies are necessary and their impact on the project

5. Security Concerns:
   - Identify any potential security issues or vulnerabilities
   - Suggest best practices for addressing these concerns

6. Integration Guidelines:
   - Provide step-by-step instructions for integrating this repository into other projects
   - Optimize these steps for an AI coding assistant to best implement

7. Emulation Guidelines:
   - Explain with succinct pseudo code how to replicate the critical parts of the code in a similar way
   - Optimize these steps for an AI coding assistant to best implement

When writing your review, adhere to these guidelines:

- Use clear, concise language suitable for a technical audience
- Prioritize accuracy and relevance of information. Do not hallucinate.
- Use markdown formatting to enhance readability (e.g., headers, lists, code blocks)
- Your final output should be a single, cohesive markdown document. 
- Begin your document with a level 1 header titled "Architecture Review: [Repository Name]", where [Repository Name] is extracted from the provided GitHub URL.
- Ensure that your ouput fits within the context window of the model you are using.

Above all, ensure you compress the output to be less than or equal to the <available_output_tokens>, as calculated earlier in the program.
